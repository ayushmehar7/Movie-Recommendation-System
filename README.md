This repo contains IPython Notebooks for different types of Recommendor Systems
1. Content-Based
    - Using Ratings and No of Raters provided in the dataset as parameters of our own custom Score function **(Score Based RS)**
    - Asking User their Preferences **(Knowledge Based RS)**
    - Finding similar movies based on the provided Overview  **(Plot Content Based RS)**
    - Finding similar movies based on Genre,Actors and Directors **(Metadata Content Based RS)**
2. Collaborative Filtering
   In Collborative Filtering we treat this as a regression problem and try to predict User Ids based on other features and recommend movies higly rated by these Users
    - Using metrics like mean and weighted mean based on demographic features like gender and occupation **(User Based RS)**
    - Using ML Clustering Algorithms like KNN and SVD to find similar users **(ML Algo Based)**
